<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li2"><span class="s2"><b></b></span><span class="s1">Why collaborate?</span></li>
  <ul class="ul2">
    <li class="li2"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">It is more fun.</span></li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">When ideas are bounced around, math gets better.</span></li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">The best sources of good problems and new tricks are your coauthors.</span></li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Coauthorship is a closer relationship than friendship. The ultimate situation is when the collaboration evolves into a long term relation, resulting a series of joint-work. That is to be cherished year after year.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <li class="li2"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">What about the division of credit?</span></li>
  <ul class="ul2">
    <li class="li2"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">In math, we use the Hardy-Littlewood rule. That is, authors are alphabetically ordered and everyone gets an equal share of credit.</span></li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">The one who has worked the most has learned the most and is therefore in the best position to write more papers on the topic.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <li class="li2"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">To do:</span></li>
  <ul class="ul2">
    <li class="li2"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Dig the brain of your advisor who is usually willing to help. Try to befriend at least one faculty each quarter. Apply the same spirit to other graduate students. Prepare something mathematical to say.</span></li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Go to seminars and colloquiums. Talk to departmental visitors and join the lunch/dinner with them.</span></li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Check announcements of meetings/workshops of mathematics and CS societies as well as numerous research centers. Participate at these professional meetings and find out the problems that other researchers are currently working on or interested in.</span></li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Some problems are particularly good for sharing, for example, those with a game flavor or in need of developing concepts. Try to have one such problem for social purposes.</span></li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Pick a problem that you really wish that you alone can solve and then enjoy/endure the frustration in secret.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <li class="li2"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Not to do:</span></li>
  <li class="li2"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">If you have any bad feeling about sharing the work or the credit, don't collaborate. In mathematics, it is quite okay to do your research independently. (Unlike other areas, you are not obliged to include the person who fund your research.) If the collaboration already has started, the Hardy-Littlewood rule says that it stays a joint work even if the contribution is not of the same proportion. You have a choice of not to collaborate the next time. (If you have many ideas, one paper doesn't matter. If you don't have many ideas, then it really doesn't matter.) You might miss the opportunity for collaboration which can enhance your research and enrich your life. Such opportunity is actually not so easy to cultivate but worths all the efforts involved.</span></li>
